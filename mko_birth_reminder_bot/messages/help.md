🎂 **Welcome to Birth Reminder Bot!** 🎂

This bot reminds you about upcoming birthdays. Below is a guide on how to use it.

📌 **Reminder Settings**  
- By default, notifications are sent **0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days** before a birthday.  
- You can also add **custom reminder** for each entry (e.g., 30 days in advance) when adding a record.  

📅 **Adding Birthdays**  
You can add birthdays in two ways:  
1️⃣ **Manually** – Using the add entry menu.  
2️⃣ **CSV Import** – Upload a file with multiple entries at once.  

✅ **Only the birthdate field is required.** Other fields are optional.  

✏️ **Editing & Deleting Entries**  
- Each entry has a unique **ID**.  
- To **edit or delete** an entry, use its ID.  
- To find an ID, **export your data** as a CSV file.  

📂 **Exporting & CSV File Details**  
- You can export all your data in a **CSV file**.  
- The file is encoded in **UTF-8**. If you see strange symbols, ensure you are using UTF-8 encoding.  
- In **Excel**, open the file using the **Import Data** function to select the correct encoding.  

🚫 **Unsubscribing & Data Removal**  
- You can **delete all entries** and completely unsubscribe from notifications if needed.  

⚠️ **Important Notes**  
- **This bot is in test mode**, so please do not fully rely on it for critical events.  
- Always **export and save your data locally** after adding new entries to prevent loss in case of errors.  
- On days with no birthday reminders, the bot will send a **random quote** for testing purposes. 
It has no other intent and is purely to ensure the bot is running. If today’s quote isn’t to your liking, don’t worry—tomorrow might be better! 😊

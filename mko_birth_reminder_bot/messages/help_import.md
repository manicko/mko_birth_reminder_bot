📄 **Upload a CSV file with birthday data, following these requirements:**
        - File encoding must be `UTF-8`
        - Keep the number and order of fields strictly
        - Use `;` as a field separator
        - Date format must be `'dd/mm/yyyy'` or `'dd.mm.yyyy'`

❗ **If you are using a previously exported file:**
        - Clear records before importing to avoid duplicates

💡 **Example of correct formatting:**
        ```company;last_name;first_name;position;gift_category;birth_date;notice_before_days
           Company A;Smith;John;HR;Manager;1995-04-18;7
           Company B;Doe;Jane;CEO;VIP;1980-09-15;30 
        ```

🎂 **Welcome to Birth Reminder Bot!** 🎂  

This bot is here to save you from the shame of forgetting birthdays. It’ll keep you informed. 
And on slow days, it’ll throw in a quote — sometimes wise, sometimes witty, but always well-intended.  

📌 **Reminder Settings**  
- By default, it nudges you `0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days` before a birthday.  
- Want more time to prepare your excuses? You can set custom reminders, too.  

📅 **Adding Birthdays** Two ways to get those dates in:      
1️⃣ The hard way – Manually, through the add entry menu.  
2️⃣ The smart way – Import a CSV and let the bot do the heavy lifting.
✅ Only the `birthdate` is required. Everything else is optional — though a name might help jog your memory.  

✏️ **Editing & Deleting Entries** 
- Each entry has a `unique ID` — like a wanted poster, but less dramatic.  
- Use the ID to edit or delete an entry.  
- Lost an ID? Export your data as a CSV, and all shall be revealed.  

📂 **Exporting & CSV File Details**   
- Export all your data in a `CSV file` for safekeeping.  
- It’s encoded in `UTF-8` — if it looks like an alien language, check your encoding settings.  
- Using Excel? `Import Data` to pick the right encoding, unless you enjoy solving puzzles.  

🚫 **Unsubscribing & Data Removal**  
- Had enough? You can **delete all entries** and unsubscribe at any time — no hard feelings.  

⚠️ **Important Notes**   
- This bot is in `test mode`, so don’t stake your reputation on it remembering Aunt Martha’s birthday.  
- Back up your data after adding new entries — just in case the bot takes a nap.  
- On quiet days, you’ll get a `random quote` instead of a birthday reminder. If today’s isn’t to your liking, don’t fret — tomorrow’s might be worse. 😏
